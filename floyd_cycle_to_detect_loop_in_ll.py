   ### 3. Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm:      
        -- Traverse linked list using two pointers.
        -- Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
        -- If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. 
           If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.
 
        ** This is the fastest method
           Here,
                time complexity --> O(n)
                auxiliary space --> O(1), No extra space is needed
